# Meditation Timer

[Meditation Timer for Android](https://www.jan-exner.de/software/android/meditationtimer) is a free, open source app that can count and beep. It helps with repeating tasks, such as meditation.

In essence, it is a simpler version of [Foto Timer](https://www.jan-exner.de/software/android/fototimer), and a rewrite of the original [Meditation Timer for PalmOS](https://www.jan-exner.de/software/palmos/meditimer) from 20 years ago.

Meditation Timer is working with "processes", which define how Meditation Timer counts, and how often it beeps. Processes can also be "chained" together, meaning that a process can automatically launch another.

Meditation Timer contains absolutely no "AI" whatsoever.
