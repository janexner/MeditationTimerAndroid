<p>Meditation Timer for Android is a free, open source app that can count and beep. It helps with repeating tasks, such as meditation.</p>

<p>In essence, it is a simpler version of Foto Timer, and a rewrite of the original Meditation Timer for PalmOS from 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Meditation Timer is working with "processes", which define how Meditation Timer counts, and how often it beeps. Processes can also be "chained" together, meaning that a process can automatically lauch another.</p>

<p>Meditation Timer contains absolutely no AI whatsoever.</p>
